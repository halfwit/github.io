			<p>So for quite some time, I was going through window managers quite frequently. I'd trial one, enjoy many points of it, and eventually find another that suited for a different reason.</p>
			<p>I really liked <a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/">dwm</a> for a few reasons. It had a wonderfully responsive stacking layout, and the tagging feature.</p>
