<h1>We Are Not Amused</h1>
<p>I've decided it's high time I get off my high horse, and write a line or two with regards to what I'm doing with my projects - both to help others skip a few mistakes I've managed to make in their own endeavors, and as a retrospective on why I made decisions in the past.</p>
<p>To follow will be my ongoing journey into coding various projects, as well as hopefully some back story on what I've done up until now. I look forward to any and all feedback about what I write here; and hope you enjoy reading it as well.</p>
