			<p>I had been reading all of the various literature about standing desks. It all seemed too good, why weren't these more popular?</p>
			<p>Oh, right. That price tag. At the time, the sit-to-stand variants that I had found were > $1,000 CDN, which is well above anything I'd be willing to pay for a desk. (Which is funny, since all told this desk probably did cost me ~$300)</p>
			<p>So it came down to either buying an existing standing-only desk, non of which I really liked, or designing something of my own to fit exactly in the space I had.</p>

			<p>I started with some dimensions, and some calculations of viewing distances from monitors, that ended up being wrong. (I've long since lost the drawings) I knew I wanted a corner desk, and to be (at the time) roughly 30" from my monitors. I had 52" from my wall to where the door opened, and in the spirit of symmetry I decided to have both wings of the corner desk extend out to that distance.</p>
			<p>Then, I was measuring from the floor to a more-or-less ideal height; I went with 40.5" tall, and had a tray that I could adjust height-wise to meet exactly.</p>

			<p>The selection of wood I started with:</p>

			<p>Later on, we had to shuffle rooms, so I was shunned to the living room.</p>

			<p>So I mean, it looked rather nice, and it worked well for the time being. I eventually removed the floating shelf, as I was using either a wobble board of a standing mat after the first while, and the height of the desk proper was fine; as well my research led me to understand that I could/should be somewhat closer. Removing the board ended up putting me in an ideal location, ~22" from my monitors, with them centered around in sweet, sweet stereo.</p>

			<p>Our Bluray situation was a bit out of hand, so I took it on a whim to build a simple stand, and really enjoyed the end result. The stain was just the right color for the living room.</p>

			<p>And that really sparked my want to finish the desk. That, and I had finally sourced a dirt-cheap third monitor, which looked pretty sharp with the rest.</p>

			<p>First bit was a cheap monitor riser</p>

			<p>Then I started to grab the wood for the drawers, built them out</p>

			<p>Which meant my huge mess of crap could go away neat and tidy, heh</p>

			<p>With all the room, I had every intention of just enjoying the desk for a while, and not doing a thing to it.</p>

			<p>It was all apart, so I took the chance to do the long-overdue cable management on the monitors.</p>

			<p>That's a bad joke, but I mean, let's be honest. It looks pretty damn good.</p>
			<img style="max-width: 99%; max-height: 99%" src="https://ptpb.pw/cfid.jpg" alt="First Half, To Wit" title="First Half, To Wit" />

			<p>Tossed all my gear in, cable management comes later</p>
			<img style="max-width: 99%; max-height: 99%" src="https://ptpb.pw/CUF4.jpg" alt="Unmanaged Cables" title="Unmanaged Cables" />
			<p>Like, immediately later.</p>
			<img style="max-width: 99%; max-height: 99%" src="https://ptpb.pw/LqwH.jpg" alt="Managed Cables" title="Managed Cables" />
			<p>For now, this comprises the finished product. Lighting and cable hiding will follow, and I'll update this when that happens! Thanks for checking it out!</p>
