<p><a href="https://ptpb.pw/Objk">Initial key layout plan</a> was born one night, during some discussion about discomfort while typing amongst some friends. A few days later, a secondary spark of inspiration hit, and this was born:

And yes, it's a coffee can cut into pieces, with the keycaps arranged using blue poster-tack.  Now, this is well and fine, but I can't seem to find the plugin anywhere, and it's certainly not connecting to bluetooth. So I fear I must go further.</p>
<p>This is my donor board, a Poker II that will be sacrificed for switches, and the metal will be repurposed to suit my needs.
