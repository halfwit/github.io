			<p><a href="https://ptpb.pw/Objk">Initial key layout plan</a> was born one night, during some discussion about discomfort while typing amongst some friends. A few days later, a secondary spark of inspiration hit, and this was born:</p>
			<img style="max-width: 99%; max-height: 99%" src="IMG_20170518_020716.jpg" alt="keyboard mock-up done with coffee can parts" title="keyboard mock-up done with coffee can parts" />
			<p>And yes, it's a coffee can cut into pieces, with the keycaps arranged using blue poster-tack.  Now, this is well and fine, but I can't seem to find the plugin anywhere, and it's certainly not connecting to bluetooth. So I fear I must go further.</p>
			<p>This is my donor board, a Poker II that will be sacrificed for switches, and the metal will be repurposed to suit my needs.</p>

			<p>I found a piece of curved wood at work that I'm going to attempt to use as a housing, for the initial version of this. (Future versions, some time in the future will end up as milled aluminum)</p>

			<p>My next step is desoldering my old keyboard, then start shaping the cases.</p>
			<p>Desoldering was held back for lack of a solder pump, so I've been working a bit on shaping out the cases. I did a test-fit of my keycaps into the wood - looks pretty good!</p>

			<p>This will go on the left hand side of the split keyboard, for numeric input.</p>

			<p>Having seen the three pieces, I was reaffirmed in my long-standing want for a trackball. It seems like it'll fit so well among the others - so I started planning one out.</p>

			<p>And switches, and the I/O expander. My first Teensy came DOA, so I have to now wait for the next one to come in to finish wiring. Also waiting to buy some stain to finish the phone dock, but it still looks pretty good!</p>

			<p>I still haven't received a working Teensy, so my keyboard is still in stasis. Painful, painful stasis. Though I did stain up everything, and it's all but done besides the electronics!</p>
