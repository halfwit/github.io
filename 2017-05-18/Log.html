<p><a href="https://ptpb.pw/Objk">Initial key layout plan</a> was born one night, during some discussion about discomfort while typing amongst some friends. A few days later, a secondary spark of inspiration hit, and this was born:

And yes, it's a coffee can cut into pieces, with the keycaps arranged using blue poster-tack.  Now, this is well and fine, but I can't seem to find the plugin anywhere, and it's certainly not connecting to bluetooth. So I fear I must go further.</p>
<p>This is my donor board, a Poker II that will be sacrificed for switches, and the metal will be repurposed to suit my needs.

<p>Stay tuned for updates!</p>
<p>I found a piece of curved wood at work that I'm going to attempt to use as a housing, for the initial version of this. (Future versions, some time in the future will end up as milled aluminum)

<p>My next step is desoldering my old keyboard, then start shaping the cases.</p>
<p>Desoldering was held back for lack of a solder pump, so I've been working a bit on shaping out the cases. I did a test-fit of my keycaps into the wood - looks pretty good!</p>
