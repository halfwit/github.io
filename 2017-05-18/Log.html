			<p><a href="https://ptpb.pw/Objk">Initial key layout plan</a> was born one night, during some discussion about discomfort while typing amongst some friends. A few days later, a secondary spark of inspiration hit, and this was born:</p>

			<p>And yes, it's a coffee can cut into pieces, with the keycaps arranged using blue poster-tack.  Now, this is well and fine, but I can't seem to find the plugin anywhere, and it's certainly not connecting to bluetooth. So I fear I must go further.</p>
			<p>This is my donor board, a Poker II that will be sacrificed for switches, and the metal will be repurposed to suit my needs.</p>

			<p>I found a piece of curved wood at work that I'm going to attempt to use as a housing, for the initial version of this. (Future versions, some time in the future will end up as milled aluminum)</p>

			<p>My next step is desoldering my old keyboard, then start shaping the cases.</p>
			<p>Desoldering was held back for lack of a solder pump, so I've been working a bit on shaping out the cases. I did a test-fit of my keycaps into the wood - looks pretty good!</p>

			<p>This will go on the left hand side of the split keyboard, for numeric input.</p>
			<p>I have been hanging on to this GH10 PCB for over a year. It's finally time to use it!</p>

			<p>Having seen the three pieces, I was reaffirmed in my long-standing want for a trackball. It seems like it'll fit so well among the others - so I started planning one out.</p>
